Precise Image Search for Personal Object Recognition

Each Folder (Object) Contains Three Types of Images: The Background Image Set (objects but not the specific object), The Object Set (Different Angles of the Query Image), and the Query Image itself to which the set must be compared. 
Each folder also contains a spreadsheet with this labelling by file name.
